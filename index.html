     <h1>FIGHTER ARCHETYPES</h1>
     <p>Fighting games are hard to pick up. To make it easier for players to learn and for game developers to create, fighting game characters are usually classified into one or more of the archetypes. Each will affect how they play, their move set, strengths, and weaknesses. There are also hybrid characters or characters with a few moves that classify them into more than one archetype. </p>
