Setplay
Setplay fighters heavily rely on calculated setups. They shine in setplay situations - creating scenarios in which opponent has limited options where they can then easily capitalize. That  usually striking the opponent whilst they are getting up after a knockdown and creating mix-up situations. Set play characters can overtake and pressure their opponents very easily by executing these pre-planned situations. However, they have very limited tools outside of this game plan if their opponent does not allow themselves to be set up. 

Toolkit:


Strengths
Unpredictable
Strong knockdown power

Weaknesses
Limited tools outside setups
