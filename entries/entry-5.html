<p id="intro">
Footsie characters fight with a poke-based strategy, controlling the space in front of them with fast mid range attacks. As the name suggests, they play at footsie range. They rely on baiting opponent, getting into a range they like and their opponent doesn’t. They have strong mid range attacks (their normal attacks), some have a long reach, or come out fast, or both. They dominate the mid range, but rarely any good attacks outside of this range. Fast walking speed allows them to get to opponent faster without the need to resort to risker options like dashing. However, a bit lacking in pressure compared to a Rushdown fighter.

<h2 id="play">How should I play as this fighter?</h2>
Use your poke-based attacks to bait your opponents. Try to keep a good range for yourself while being able to get out of the pocket. Although you have faster attacks, defense is a vital part of your play style as that is what helps you bait your opponent most of the time when you are in the pocket while taking minimal damage. Practicing defense will help you utilize your footwork even better. 

<h2>How can I beat this fighter?</h2>
Keep your distance or get into their face. Footsies excel at the mid-range but have limited tools to combat your attacks outside of this range. They will try and bait you using their defense. Try to find any patterns in their moves and combat accordingly. 

<h2>Examples: </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Chun Li (Street Fighter II, 1991)</li>
  <li>Jun Kazama (Tekken 2, 1995)</li>
  <li>Sergei Dragunov (Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection, 2005)</li>
</ul>

Difficulty: ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ <br>
<br>
Footsies play on a defensive poking strategy, which can be hard to manage as a beginner. You would need to think about how to bait your opponents and setting them up to give yourself openings for attacks. Otherwise, the move set a footsie has will not perform at full potential.
