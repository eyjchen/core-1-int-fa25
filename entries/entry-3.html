   <p>Rushdown characters are some of the fastest characters on the roster. They have a high pressure play style that focuses on getting into range quickly and overwhelming their opponents with attacks. They have extremely high mobility which allows them apply pressure quickly and slip out of attacks easily, and their usually smaller hit boxes make them harder to hit. Rushdown characters work well in close range. They love to put opponents into mix-ups - situations where the opponent is forced to predict how they will attack. </p>

Play aggressive. Utilize your high mobility to your advantage. Once you get into range, stay there and use that momentum to pummel your opponents with attacks until they die. 
<H2>How can I beat this fighter?</H2>
Rushdown charactersâ€™ toolkit falls a bit short when they are out of their comfort range (usually mid to close). Be careful, however. Their fast forward dashes still allow them to get into your face if there is an opening. <H2>Examples:</H2>
<li>Cammy White (Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers, 1993)</li>
<li>Zero Suit Samus (Super Smash Bros. Brawl, 2008)</li>
<li>Ibuki (Street Fighter III: New Generation, 1997)</li>
<H2>Evelynn's Notes & Difficulty Rating</H2>
4/5
Rushdown characters can be very overwhelming for beginners to pick up.  are heavy. It relies so much on damage output that it can put you at risk of punishment if pressure isn't applied enough for the opponent.
