<p id="intro">
Rushdown characters are some of the fastest characters on the roster. They have a high pressure play style that focuses on getting into range quickly and overwhelming their opponents with attacks. They have extremely high mobility which allows them apply pressure quickly and slip out of attacks easily, and their usually smaller hit boxes make them harder to hit. Rushdown characters work well in close range. They love to put opponents into mix-ups - situations where the opponent is forced to predict how they will attack.

<h2>Cons</h2>

  <li>Lower health pool</li>
  <li>Limited range</li>
  <li>Reliance on momentum</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="play">How should I play as this fighter?</h2>
Play aggressive. Utilize your high mobility to your advantage. Once you get into range, stay there and use this momentum and pummel your opponents with attacks.

<h2>How can I beat this fighter?</h2>
Rushdown characters’ toolkit falls short when they are out of their comfort range (usually mid to close). Be careful, however. Their fast forward dashes still allow them to get into your face if there is an opening. 

<h2>Examples: </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ibuki (Street Fighter III: New Generation, 1997)</li>
  <li>Cammy White (Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers, 1993)</li>
  <li>Zero Suit Samus (Super Smash Bros. Brawl, 2008)</li>
</ul>

Difficulty: ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆<br>
<br>
Rushdown characters can be overwhelming for beginners to pick up because of their high mobility and high pressure play style. Their fast attacks require agile execution and quick decision-making to get ahead of the move and their opponent. It relies so much on damage output that it can put you at risk if the opponent gets out of range, so constant pressure should be applied. This can be tough for new players.
