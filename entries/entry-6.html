   <p>Stance fighters are characters that can switches between 2 or more forms that are called stances. This allows them to have different move sets for each one. They may have a stance that keeps, enhances, or changes their style. Their complexity is based on how complex their stance is and how it affects their normal fighting style. They can use this to their advantage when planning for different approaches in defeating their opponent. </p>

<H2>Evelynn's Notes & Difficulty Rating</H2>
4/5
Stance characters are quite complicated to understand because of the uniqueness to each of their move sets. It can take a while for new players to grasp just one, but the full potential of a stance is only realized when the player is able to incorporate all aspects of the character.
