<p id="intro">
All-rounders are the most balanced fighters. They don’t have any obvious strengths or weaknesses. That means they have a balanced defense to offense skill, high/low attacks, damage dealt/taken etc. One type of all-rounder fighter is called the Shoto. Named after Ryu and Ken from Street Fighter, this type of all-rounder usually has three significant moves. A fireball, an upwards kick, and a spinning kick that launches them forward. Although not every all-rounder is a Shoto, their attacks are still based on these same fundamentals.

<p>Being a balanced fighter makes all-rounders extremely versatile. Their balanced move set allows them to control the game at any position on screen. Get to know the move set and try out how they match-up against different archetypes. </p>

<h2>How can I beat this fighter?</h2>
  <img src="../img/Ryu/ryu-slam.gif"> 
<p>Being balanced means that all-rounders don’t excel in a particular area. Utilize the strengths of your fighter, especially at moments where the all-rounder’s balanced nature limits them from achieving the same output as you in a certain area.</p>

<h2>Examples: </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ryu (Street Fighter, 1987)</li>
  <li>Ken Masters (Street Fighter, 1987)</li>
  <li>Jin Kazama (Tekken 3, 1997)</li>
</ul>
