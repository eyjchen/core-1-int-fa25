   <p>Unorthodox characters are as the name suggests, unorthodox. From their tools, their look, and they way they move, unorthodox characters have something about them that is different from every other character in the game. They may have attacks or specials that deter from the rules previously set by the game. Even the way their attacks come out can be odd, which makes them very unpredictable.</p>

<H2>Evelynn's Notes & Difficulty Rating</H2>
4/5
Certain unorthodox characters may have moves or special gimmicks that allow for easier gameplay since they can be the only one who doesn’t follow the rules. However, other unorthodox  characters may be very difficult for beginners to handle. Because they have unconventional move sets, the logic behind how you play other characters may not apply to this fighter, and their odd movement makes it hard to set up combos.
