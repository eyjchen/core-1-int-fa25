   <p>Each character on the roster would have a regular grab, but grapplers have special ones called command grabs. Command grabs are different from regular grabs, usually dealing more damage and executed by a specific input (instead of just one or two buttons like a regular grab). Grapplers want to close the distance between the opponent and use these unique throw attacks. Once in range, these attacks deal a massive amount of damage. However, many of these moves have a slow start and tell tale signs that opponents can pick up on and react, so they require quite a bit of set up. They can also be comboâ€™d into or out of.</p>

<H2>How should I play as this fighter?</H2>
Close the gap. Feeling the pressure from you forces your opponent to constantly react to your advances. Although your moves are slower and telegraphs, something setup??
<H2>How can I beat this fighter?</H2>
Keep them at bay. Grapplers lack range and mobility, so utilize mid to long range attacks you have to prevent them from closing the gap. This renders their throws useless, and they will need to work around your attacks to get into range to deal damage. 
<H2>Examples:</H2>
<li>Hugo Andore (Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact, 1997)</li>
<li>Youkai Kusaregedo (Samurai Shodown V, 2003)</li>
<li>King (Tekken, 1994)</li>
